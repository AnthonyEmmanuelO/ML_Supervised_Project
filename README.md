# Supervised Machine Learning Project

#### Hi! The reason I do this porject is to test my skills and also try to use all the supervised machine learning technique I've learned so far. The project contain 2 parts. The detail is down below.

## Dataset
I got the dataset from Kaggle (an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners). 

One is about used cars price, the other is about income classification. 

The link is down below:

[**Regression**: autos](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database "used cars regression")

[**Classification**: income](https://www.kaggle.com/lodetomasi1995/income-classification "income classification")

## Part 1

The **Part-1.ipynb** file contain 2 sections, the first section is classification part and the second section is regression part.

### Section1

It contains EDA part, KNN classification, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Kerenilzed Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree. I implemented grid search with cross validation to find the best parameter for the models and wrote down my conclusion and my discover along the project.

### Section2

It  contains EDA part, KNN regressor, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, polynomial regression, SVM both simple and with kernels. I used cross-validation to find average training and testing score. Finally, I found the best regressor for this dataset and train my models on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict the target values for the test_set.

## Part 2

I seperated part 2 into two files: __Part-2_classification.ipynb__ & __Part-2_regression.ipynb__ . I thought that would be more clear if I seperated my analysis into two files.

### Classification

I kept the EDA part and my analysis contains voting classifiers(both hard and soft), bagging & pasting, adaboost, gradient boost, PCA (for dimension reduction) and deep learning model. 

### Regression

Like the classification part, I kept my EDA from part1 and my analysis includes bagging & pasting, adaboost, gradient boost, PCA and deep learning model.

This wraped up my practice, hope it hlped you guys, thank you very much.
